In this quiz application I designed a container for question which contains
a) A text field for the number question we run.
b) A text area for the question itself .
c) 4 buttons that was similar to response (A,B,C,D) respectively.
d) A label for each possible answer
e) And a timer that will count down from 10 and when it will go to zero it will skip to next question.

Once our questions are complete it will display the result like how many questions did you answered color out of total numbers of questions displayed and how much percentage you scored.
